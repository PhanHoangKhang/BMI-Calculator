This BMI calculator program helps to calculate BMI of users and then identify if they are balanced or not. If they are not balanced, it will also identify how much weight that they neeed to gain or lose to be balanced. 

When running the program, users are asked to choose among three options. Option 1 is to input users' info, including height, weight, and gender. Option 2 is to display the BMI list of all users. Option 3 is to exit the program.
